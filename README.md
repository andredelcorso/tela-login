# Login screen project
## CSS and HTML project

### What have I learned? 

- I saw concepts about viewport (vw and vh) and how this rule works to split two or more stuff in my project;
- I got how CSS works better if you think that everything is a box; 
- In this challenge I applied some contents like paddings and margins to understand how to assign all area of my page;

### What I Need to do to improve this project? 

- I need to use Media Query to make bring more responsivity and make the login screen fits in any screen easily.
