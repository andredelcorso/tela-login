# Login screen project
## CSS and HTML project

- In this exercise I have tried to challenge myself to make a simple login screen;
- I've learned about viewport (vw and vh) and how this rule works to split two or more stuff in my content;
- In this challenge I applied some contents like paddings and margins to understand how I can apply this correctly to make a good page;
- In the future this page will be more responsible. 
- It's my duty to take this project and turnt it in something that will fit in any screen.
